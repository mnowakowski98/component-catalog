# Component catalog

A thing I'm making to have an excuse to make an overcomplicated tech stack to learn stuff or something.

Designed to keep track of electrical components for use in other projects.

## Using

- Next js
- Apollo
- Docker
- Something for a database (maybe crate but haven't gotten anything working yet)
